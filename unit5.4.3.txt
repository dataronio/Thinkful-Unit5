DRILL: When to use surveys

1. Popularity of Uber drivers: Yes, surveys would be useful.  It would be good for finding out exceptionally good and bad drivers.
The survey should come with a reward to encourage participation in average cases.

2. Popularity of ice cream - No, A survey would not be a good idea.  Simply use sales data. Sales data will give you a direct measurement
of differences in popularity of the ice cream flavors.

3. Trojan condoms - Yes a survey would be a good idea due to the sensitive nature of the issues involved.

4. There has been an unexpected increase in use at HappyCar.  Past behavioral data would not be useful.  We need to directly survey to
find the cause.

5. Yes surveys could help in assessing the success rate of new advertising.

6. Patient/nurse ratios are not knowable by the general population. You should collect data from many hospitals with differing
ratios and use known patient data to measure a patient recovery effect.  Surveys would not be helpful.
